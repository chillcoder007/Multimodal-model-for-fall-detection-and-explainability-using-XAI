# Multimodal-model-for-fall-detection-and-explainability-using-XAI
This project delivers a real-time, robust, and transparent fall detection system designed for older adults and vulnerable individuals at risk of injury from falls. Leveraging a multimodal approach, the system fuses data from wearable sensors (such as accelerometers) with visual input from cameras.
